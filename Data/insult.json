  "333": "You’re the reason nobody likes you.",
  "334": "‘Pew! Pew! Pew!’ That’s the sound of me deflecting your whiny b*tching with my happiness shield.",
  "335": "You consistently set low expectations and fail to achieve them.",
  "336": "Some people bring joy wherever they go. You, on the other hand, bring joy whenever you go.",
  "337": "Sometimes, I wish I was deaf so your grammar wouldn’t bother me so much.",
  "338": "I would like to leave you with one thought, but I’m not sure if you have anywhere to store it in.",
  "339": "Remember when I asked for your opinion? Yeah, me neither.",
  "340": "Shock me, say something intelligent.",
  "341": "Sometimes, it’s better to keep your mouth shut and give the impression that you’re stupid rather than open it and remove all doubt.",
  "342": "I’d slap you, but that would be animal abuse.",
  "343": "I thought of you today, and it pissed me off.",
  "344": "Isn’t this a battle of wits? You appear to be unarmed.",
  "345": "I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public.",
  "346": "You couldn’t handle me even if I came with instructions.",
  "347": "On your mark, get set, go f*ck yourself!",
  "348": "You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.",
  "349": "The last time I saw something like you, I flushed it.",
  "350": "My life may be a joke, but it’s not as funny as your face.",
  "351": "Now I know why everyone talks about you behind your back.",
  "352": "If what you don't know can't hurt you, you're invulnerable.",
  "353": "If you’re gonna be a smartass, first you have to be smart. Otherwise, you’re just an ass.",
  "354": "Shit happens. I mean, look at your face.",
  "355": "You should introduce your upper lip to your lower lip sometime and shut up!",
  "356": "I wanna give you a high five...on the face...with a hammer.",
  "357": "If you’re going to wait for me to care, I hope you brought something to eat—because it’s probably going to take you a really long time.",
  "358": "Seriously, your mouth is so foul! Should I offer you a tic-tac or a toilet paper?",
  "359": "You must think you’re strong, but you only smell strong.",
  "360": "What you lack in intelligence, you more than make up for in stupidity.",
  "361": "I’d give you a nasty look, but I see you've already got one.",
  "362": "Did you fall from heaven? Because so did Satan!",
  "363": "Don't feel bad. A lot of people have no talent.",
  "364": "Keep talking. Who knows, someday you might be able to say something intelligent.",
  "365": "I may not be perfect, but at least I’m not you.",
  "366": "You’re like the end pieces of a loaf of bread. Everyone touches you, but nobody wants you.",
  "367": "Hey, I found your nose. It was in my business.",
  "368": "I’d insult you, but then I’d have to explain it afterwards, so never mind.",
  "369": "I’m not bossy. I just know what you should be doing.",
  "370": "You fear success, but you really have nothing to worry about.",
  "371": "You are like the sun—not because you light up my world, but because it hurts to look at you.",
  "372": "You look like something that came out of a slow cooker.",
  "373": "If laughter is the best medicine, your face must be curing the world.",
  "374": "I hope your day becomes filled with people like you.",
  "375": "If I had a dollar for every time you said something smart, I'd be broke.",
  "376": "You’re not pretty enough to be that stupid.",
  "377": "Brains aren't everything. In your case, they're nothing.",
  "378": "How do you keep yourself from not choking on the constant flow of bullsh*t that’s coming out of your mouth? You are seriously amazing!",
  "379": "If stupid could fly, you’d be a jet.",
  "380": "Keep talking...I’m diagnosing you.",
  "381": "I don’t understand your specific kind of ‘stupidity,’ but I do admire your total commitment to it.",
  "382": "Are you always so stupid or is today a special occasion?",
  "383": "I tried to put myself in your shoes, but they were cheap and ugly just like you.",
  "384": "You smell like drama and headache. Please stay away from me!",
  "385": "Can you die of constipation? I ask because I’m worried about how full of sh*t you are.",
  "386": "Life is full of disappointments, and I just added you to the list.",
  "387": "I can tell when you’re lying. Your lips are moving.",
  "388": "May the chocolate chips in your cookies always turn out to be raisins.",
  "389": "Were you born this stupid, or did you take lessons?",
  "390": "Of all the mistakes in the world, you are the mistakiest!",
  "391": "I will ignore you so hard you will start doubting your existence.",
  "392": "Before you tell me what I did wrong, you should first know that I don’t care.",
  "393": "If you’re going to act like a turd, go lay on the yard.",
  "394": "I get so emotional when you’re not around. The emotion is happiness, by the way.",
  "395": "I expected an intellectual conversation, but it seems there’s no one around to have that with.",
  "396": "Just because I’m smiling doesn’t mean I don’t want to hit you in the face.",
  "397": "You are not as bad as people say. You are much, MUCH worse!",
  "398": "I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.",
  "399": "I would slap you but sh*t splatters, and that would be too much of a mess.",
  "400": "How long did it take you to come up with that one?",
  "401": "I’d like to see things from your view, but I can’t get my head that far up my ass.",
  "402": "I bet your brain feels as good as new, seeing that you’ve never used it.",
  "403": "I’ve met several pricks before, but you sir are a cactus.",
  "404": "You look like a ‘before’ picture.",
  "405": "There’s someone for everyone, and the person for you is a psychiatrist.",
  "406": "Let's go to the zoo. I've always wanted to meet your family.",
  "407": "You shouldn’t act hard-to-get when you’re already hard-to-like.",
  "408": "Here, let me wash the stupid right off of you. Oh wait, it’s not coming off.",
  "409": "You speak an infinite deal of nothing.",
  "410": "It’s okay if you don’t like me. Not everyone has good taste.",
  "411": "Your brain has two parts—the 'left' and the 'right'. On the left side, there's nothing right. On the right side, there's nothing left.",
  "412": "It must be hard putting makeup on your two faces.",
  "413": "I didn’t know that answering a question was considered ‘talking back.’",
  "414": "If you don't like my opinion of you—improve yourself!",
  "415": "Whenever we hang out, I remember that God really does have a sense of humor.",
  "416": "If you ran like your mouth, you’d be in good shape.",
  "417": "I would ask you how old you are, but I know that you can't count that high.",
  "418": "2 words, 1 finger. Do the math!",
  "419": "You are so ugly that when you looked in the mirror, your reflection walked away.",
  "420": "There’s only one thing that keeps me from breaking you in half—I don’t want two of you around!",
  "421": "Even dogs don’t like you.",
  "422": "Jealousy is a disease. Get well soon!",
  "423": "If ignorance is bliss, you must be the happiest person on the planet.",
  "424": "If you spoke your mind, you’d be speechless.",
  "425": "I heard your parents took you to a dog show and you won.",
  "426": "Sorry for the mean, awful accurate things I said.",
  "427": "Maybe you should eat some makeup so you can be pretty on the inside too.",
  "428": "Are you afraid that zombies will eat your brain? Nah, you’ll be fine.",
  "429": "If everyone was like you, the human race would lose faith in the world.",
  "430": "When your mom dropped you off at school, she got apprehended by the authorities for littering.",
  "431": "I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.",
  "432": "Since narcissistic is such a big word for you, how about asshole? You know what an asshole is, right?",
  "433": "I’m sorry you got offended that one time you were treated the exact way you treat everyone all the time.",
  "434": "Me, jealous of you? Bless your delusional heart!",
  "435": "Oops, my bad. I could’ve sworn I was dealing with an adult.",
  "436": "If I were a bird, you’d be the first person I’d poop on.",
  "437": "Stupidity is not a crime, so you’re free to go.",
  "438": "I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain this to you.",
  "439": "I wasn’t born with enough middle fingers to let you know how I feel.",
  "440": "Please cancel my subscription to your issues.",
  "441": "Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize my happiness makes you so miserable.",
  "442": "If you really want to know about mistakes, you should ask your parents.",
  "443": "The only thing I don’t like about you is that constant inhaling and exhaling habit you have.",
  "444": "Mind if I ask where the OFF button for your mouth is?",
  "445": "Here’s a tissue, you have a little piece of sh*t on your lips.",
  "446": "I hope you step on a LEGO.",
  "447": "I’m sorry I didn’t get that. I don’t speak bullsh*t.",
  "448": "It’s okay if you disagree with me. I can’t force you to be right.",
  "449": "I may be fat, but fat can be burned. Ugly, on the other hand, is much more difficult to fix.",
  "450": "If I wanted a b*tch, I would have purchased a dog.",
  "451": "Unless your name is Google, stop acting like you know everything!",
  "452": "You know what’s funny? Not you, so shut up!",
  "453": "I’d like to help you out. Which way did you come in?",
  "454": "Long story short, because you wouldn’t be able to follow with the long one.",
  "455": "Goeth & fucketh thyself!",
  "456": "Beauty is skin deep, but ugly is to the bone.",
  "457": "May you always step on a wet spot after putting on fresh socks.",
  "458": "May both sides of your pillow be uncomfortably warm.",
  "459": "There's only one problem with your face, I can see it.",
  "460": "I told my therapist about you.",
  "461": "Did your parents ever ask you to run away?",
  "462": "So if I typed ‘idiot’ into Google image search, would your picture come up?",
  "463": "I don’t know what your problem is, but I’m guessing it’s hard to pronounce.",
  "464": "I’d love to kill you with kindness, but all I have is this chainsaw.",
  "465": "Who ate your bowl of sunshine this morning, thundercloud?",
  "466": "I’m not arguing. I’m simply explaining why I’m right.",
  "467": "You have the right to remain silent because whatever you say will probably be stupid anyway.",
  "468": "Don't you love nature despite what it did to you?",
  "469": "I’m not insulting you. I’m describing you.",
  "470": "Calling you an idiot would be an insult to all stupid people in the world.",
  "471": "I’m busy, you’re ugly. Have a nice day.",
  "472": "I don’t know what makes you so stupid, but it really works.",
  "473": "Look at the time, it’s time for you to shut the f*ck up!",
  "474": "You are about to exceed the limits of my medication.",
  "475": "I can only please one person a day. Today isn’t your day. Tomorrow isn’t looking good either.",
  "476": "My alone time is meant for your safety.",
  "477": "I desire that we be better strangers.",
  "478": "In order to insult me, I must first value your opinion. Nice try though."
